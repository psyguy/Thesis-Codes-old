% Set the window lengths directly, in number of samples. Generally, the average 
% should be smaller than the peak, since it will tend to flatten out if it gets

% first window and goes to the end of the sound file, indicated by 
% length(averageenv). The MatLab command sum takes some range of a 
% vector, and gives you back the sum.

% ghost of Sam and Dave to allow us to overprint on the current graph, so that 
% we can show all three lines together. The rest of this is just MatLab 
% graphics instructions (titles, labels, axes, etc.). The colors are the
